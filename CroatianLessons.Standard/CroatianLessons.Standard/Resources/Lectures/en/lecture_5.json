      "Memo": "This is formal (or plural) phrase. As a tourist in Croatia, you would use it in most of the situations. If giving something to your Croatian friend, or in other informal situations you would say \"Izvoli.\"\n\nEven more informal and shorter version you can use is \"Evo ti.\" or just \"Evo!\", meaning \"Here!\"\n\nIf asked as a question \"Izvolite?\" means \"What can I do for you?\"",

      "Translation": "Thank you!",
      "Memo": "\"Hv\" is quite difficult to pronounce, and if it's easier for you, you can say \"Fala\". Many Croatians do the same.\n\nIf you are really grateful, you can add some adjectives, like:\n\"Hvala lijepo\" = \"Thank you nicely\"\n\"Hvala puno\" = \"Thanks a lot\"\n\"Veliko vam hvala\" = \"A big thank you\"",

For example, \"Molim Vas, pokažite mi.\" means \"Please, show me.\". If you say just \"Molim te!\" or \"Molim Vas!\" it could mean \"I beg you!\", in informal and formal versions.\n\nJust \"Molim.\", can be shortened from \"Ja molim.\" which means \"I pray.\"",
