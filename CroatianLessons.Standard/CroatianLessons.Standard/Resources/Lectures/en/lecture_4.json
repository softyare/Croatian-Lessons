      "Memo": "For example, \"How are you?\" we ask \"Kako si (ti)?\". Ususaly, we omit personal pronouns when it's obvious from the verb \"to be\" who the subject of the sentence is. You would use it in the case you want to put accent on it, for example if you answer on the same question someone just asked you: \"Kako si?\" - \"Dobro. Kako si ti?\".\nGeneral answer on question \"Kako?\" is \"Tako.\", meaning \"Like that.\" or \"So.\". It's easy to remember: \"Kako? - Tako!\"",
